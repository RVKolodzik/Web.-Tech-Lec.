=========================================================

Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)
	-> language used to specify the presentation aspects (eg. layout and formatting) of structurally marked up documents
	-> developed by Haikon Wium Lie (CHSS) and Bert Bos (SSP)
	-> reasons:
		- CSS1 (1996)
		- CSS 2.1 (2011) (Updated 2016)
		------(CSS1 and CSS 2.1 had centralized repo)--------
		- CSS 3 *(modules)* (Last Version)
			-> can be recommended if matured enough
			-> if not tagged with level 3 it is entirely new which was not added in CSS 2.1
	-> CSS Preprocessors, CSS Frameworks

HTML/XHTML Stylesheets
	-> author styles
	-> user style (overrides the author's style)
	-> user agent style (example default CSS 2.1 stylesheet for HTML 4)

CSS Statements
	-> @ - Rules
		> @charset
		> @import
		> @media
		> @font-face
		> @keyframes
		> @page

Author Styles
	-> external stylesheets (recommended --> link)
	-> embedded styles
	-> inline styles

Media
	-> screen
	-> print
	-> speech

CSS Rule Sets (aka CSS Rules, Style Rules)
	-> consists of a selection, followed by a brace-enclosed declaration block which contains zero or more semi-colon separated by .....


CSS Selectors
	-> selector
		> Structure used as a condition in a CSS rule to determine which elements in the document tree are matched by the selector and are thus targeted by the formatting specified in the CSS rule
	-> Selector Syntax
		> chain of one or more sequences of simple selectors separated by combinators, with one psuedo-element possibly appended to the last sequence
		> sequence of simple selectors
			--> chain of simple selectors but separated by combinators
			--> always start with a type selector or a universal selector
			--> cannot contain other type selectors or universal selectors
		> group selectors
			--> comma-separated list of selectors representing the union of all elements selected by each of the selectors in the list
		> sipmle selectors
			-->type selectors (ex: p, div, span)
			--> universal selectors (ex: *)
			--> attribute selectors
				[attr]
					[attr = value]
					[attr ~= value] (one value *class*)
					[attr |= value] (lang attr. ex: [lang |= en])
					[attr ^= value] (css 3)
					[attr $= value] (css 3)
					[attr *= value] (css 3)

						^ = start
						$ = end
						* = anywhere between

			--> class selectors
			--> ID selectors
			--> pseudo-class
				.) dynamic pseudo-class
					> link pseudo-class
						-> :link
						-> :visited
					> user action pseudo-classes
						-> :hover
						-> :active
						-> :focus
				.) target pseudo-class
					> :target (css3)

				.) language pseudo-class
					>: lang()

				.) UI element states pseudo-classes
					> :enabled
					> :disabled
					> :checked
					> :intermidiate
					--------(all UI element states -> css3)---------

				.) structural pseudo-classes
					> :root
					> :first-child
					> :last-child
					> :only-child
					> :nth-child()
					> :nth-last-child()
					> :first-of-type
					> :last-of-type
					> :only-of-type
					> :nth-of-type()
					> :nth-last-of-type()
					> :empty

					*nth = a(n) + b, odd, even
					--------(all but :first-child are introduced in css3)----------

		> combinators
			--> descendant combinator (whitespace, ie. space, tab, line feed, carriage return, form feed)
			--> child combinator (>)
			--> sibling combinators
				.) adjacent sibling combinator (+)
				.) general sibling combinator (~) *css3
		> pseudo-elements
			--> ::first-letter
			--> ::first-line
			--> ::before
			--> ::after
			----------(css3)-----------
			--> :first-letter
			--> :first-line
			--> :before
			--> :after
			----------(css2)-----------

CSS Rule Precedence
	1) by origin and importance (cascading origins, !important)
		- user agent important declarations
		- user important declarations
		- author important declarations
		- author normal declarations
		- user normal declarations
		- user agent normal declarations
	2) by specificity
		- inline style
		- # of ID selectors
		- # of class selectors, attriute selectors, and pseudo-classes
		- # of type selectors and pseudo-elements
	3) by order (last declaration)

CSS Declarations
	-> properties
		- shorthand properties
		- vendor-specific extensions (aka vendor prefixes)
	-> values
		- keywords
		- numbers (integers and reals in decimal notation)
		- dimensions
			> lenght, angle, duration, frequency, resolution
			> length units:
				.) font-relative: em ex ch rem
				.) viewport-percentage: vw vmin vmax
				.) absolute lengths: cm mm q in pt pc px
			> angle units: deg grad rad turn
			> duration units: s ms
			> frequency units: hz khz
			> resolution units: dpi dpcm dppx
		- percentages
		- URLs and URIs
		- colors
		- strings
	-> functions: calc() attr() counter() counters() linear-gradient() radial-gradient() translate() scale() rotate() etc.
